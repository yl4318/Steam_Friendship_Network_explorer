## Steam Friendship Network Explorer

Want to find out who's your friends' friends? Curious about what games do they play for most of the time? This web APP tries to visualize the friendship network on Steam for anyone who has a Steam ID. 

The default Steam ID already in the input box is mine which generates a rather small network.  Your Steam ID should be found at the end of your Steam Profile page URL. Just Click Submit to find out how this works!   

NOTE: 30 secs to several minitutes of waiting should be expected to allow for retrieving live data from Steam Web APIs!
